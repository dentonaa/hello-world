# hello-world
we share

I am an applied (marine) physicist/climate scientist specializing in cryospheric/polar remote sensing.

Currently I am a postdoc at Yale working on a Multi University Research Initiative funded by the Office of Naval Research to improve mathematical models of sea ice. 

Here I will share algorithms I have written for the processing and analysis of satellite imagery of sea ice, for use in understanding sea ice dynamics and interactions. 

In addition, I will share links to the data repositories containing imagery-derived product datasets generated by these algorithms.
